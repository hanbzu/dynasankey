# Minimal example of the simplified YAML structure
# This shows a simple 3-node flow: Source -> Process -> Sink

values:
    # Input parameters (constants)
    input_total: 100
    loss_rate: 0.1

    # Flow values (formulas)
    flow_in: input_total
    flow_loss: flow_in * loss_rate
    flow_out: flow_in * (1 - loss_rate)

nodes:
    - id: source
      label: "Source"
    - id: process
      label: "Process Node"
    - id: sink
      label: "Sink"
    - id: losses
      label: "Losses"

flows:
    - id: flow_in
      from: source
      to: process
      label: "Input"
    - id: flow_out
      from: process
