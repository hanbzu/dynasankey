# Simplified YAML structure example: Power Distribution Network
# This example shows how to model a power distribution system with transmission losses

values:
    # Input parameters (constants)
    total_energy: 1000
    residential_demand: 400
    loss_rate: 0.15

    # Flow formulas (calculated values)
    src_trans: total_energy
    trans_res: residential_demand
    trans_loss: src_trans * loss_rate
    # trans_ind will be solved via balance constraint at transmission node

# Graph nodes
nodes:
    - id: source
      label: "Power Plant"
    - id: transmission
      label: "Transmission Lines"
    - id: residential
      label: "Residential"
    - id: industrial
      label: "Industrial"
    - id: losses
      label: "Line Losses"

# Directed flows between nodes
flows:
    - id: src_trans
      from: source
      to: transmission
      label: "Generated Power"
    - id: trans_res
      from: transmission
      to: residential
      label: "To Homes"
    - id: trans_ind
